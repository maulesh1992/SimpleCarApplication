# SimpleCarApplication

Creating a simple C# console Application and Menu Driven Car List Application with persistent data. 
I can add car's ID, Year, Make, Model, and Color. Then I will have an option to view, Edit, and delete
the car Information that waas entered. All the data we entered would be save into a file, 
so that if you are re-running the program, then you do not have add any old data. The file should be able to
read, view, edit, and delete the data from the file that stored in to a disk(memory). 

My Menu will display as below:
